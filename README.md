1. Burndown Chart

Description: A graphical representation of work left to do versus time. It shows the progress of tasks completed over the course of a sprint or project.
Derivation/Formula: The chart plots the remaining work (usually in story points or hours) on the vertical axis and time (days or iterations) on the horizontal axis.
Example: At the start of a 2-week sprint, the total work is estimated at 100 story points. Each day, track the number of story points completed and subtract it from the total. If 10 story points are completed on the first day, the remaining work is 90 story points. Plot this daily to visualize progress.
2. Test Run Report

Description: A comprehensive report summarizing the outcomes of a test run, including the number of test cases executed, passed, failed, and blocked.
Derivation/Formula: The report is typically generated from the test management tool and includes various statistics and insights about the test execution.
Example: If 100 test cases were executed, with 85 passing, 10 failing, and 5 blocked, the test run report will detail these results along with any relevant logs and observations.
3. Test Coverage

Description: Measures the extent to which the software has been tested, typically in terms of the percentage of code, requirements, or functionalities covered by the test cases.
Derivation/Formula: Test Coverage (%) = (Number of items covered by tests / Total number of items) * 100
Example: If 80 out of 100 requirements have been tested, the test coverage is (80 / 100) * 100% = 80%.
4. Productivity

Description: Measures the efficiency of the testing team in terms of test cases executed per unit time or effort.
Derivation/Formula: Productivity = Number of Test Cases Executed / Total Time or Effort Spent
Example: If a team executes 50 test cases in 10 hours, the productivity is 50 test cases / 10 hours = 5 test cases per hour.
5. Defects

Description: Tracks the number and types of defects identified during testing.
Derivation/Formula: Count of identified defects.
Example: If 25 defects are identified during a test cycle, this metric tracks those defects along with their severity and priority.
6. Defect Density

Description: Measures the number of defects identified per unit of software size, such as lines of code or function points.
Derivation/Formula: Defect Density = Number of Defects / Size of the Software Module
Example: If 15 defects are found in a module with 1,000 lines of code, the defect density is 15 / 1,000 = 0.015 defects per line of code.
7. Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM) Metrics

Description: Ensures that all requirements are covered by test cases and tracks the relationship between requirements and test cases.
Derivation/Formula: RTM typically lists requirements, their associated test cases, and the status of each test case.
Example: If requirement R1 is covered by test cases T1 and T2, and both test cases have been executed and passed, the RTM will show full traceability and coverage for R1.
8. Test Analysis Effort

Description: Measures the time and effort spent analyzing test results, identifying defects, and preparing test reports.
Derivation/Formula: Test Analysis Effort = Total Time Spent on Test Analysis
Example: If a team spends 20 hours analyzing test results and preparing reports, the test analysis effort is 20 hours.
9. Test Design Efficiency

Description: Measures the effectiveness and efficiency of the test design process.
Derivation/Formula: Test Design Efficiency = Number of Effective Test Cases Designed / Total Time Spent on Test Design
Example: If 30 effective test cases are designed in 10 hours, the test design efficiency is 30 / 10 = 3 effective test cases per hour.
10. Test Review Efficiency

Description: Measures the time and effort spent reviewing and improving test cases.
Derivation/Formula: Test Review Efficiency = Number of Test Cases Reviewed / Total Time Spent on Review
Example: If 20 test cases are reviewed in 2 hours, the test review efficiency is 20 / 2 = 10 test cases per hour.
11. Test Effectiveness %

Description: Measures the effectiveness of testing in identifying defects.
Derivation/Formula: Test Effectiveness (%) = (Number of Defects Detected by Testing / Total Number of Defects) * 100
Example: If 40 defects are detected by testing out of 50 total defects (including those found in production), the test effectiveness is (40 / 50) * 100% = 80%.
12. Defect Injection Rate

Description: Measures the number of defects introduced during the development process.
Derivation/Formula: Defect Injection Rate = Number of Defects Introduced / Total Development Effort
Example: If 50 defects are introduced during 200 hours of development, the defect injection rate is 50 / 200 = 0.25 defects per hour.
13. Defect Closure Rate

Description: Measures the rate at which identified defects are closed.
Derivation/Formula: Defect Closure Rate = (Number of Defects Closed / Total Number of Defects Identified) * 100
Example: If 30 out of 50 identified defects are closed, the defect closure rate is (30 / 50) * 100% = 60%.
14. Rejected Defects

Description: Tracks the number of reported defects that are rejected as invalid or not reproducible.
Derivation/Formula: Count of rejected defects.
Example: If 5 out of 50 reported defects are rejected, this metric tracks those 5 defects as rejected.
15. Defect Slippage Ratio

Description: Measures the percentage of defects that escape to production after release.
Derivation/Formula: Defect Slippage Ratio (%) = (Number of Defects Found in Production / Total Number of Defects) * 100
Example: If 5 defects are found in production out of 50 total defects identified, the defect slippage ratio is (5 / 50) * 100% = 10%.
16. Cost per Bug

Description: Measures the cost associated with finding and fixing a defect.
Derivation/Formula: Cost per Bug = Total Cost of Testing / Number of Defects Found
Example: If the total cost of testing is $10,000 and 50 defects are found, the cost per bug is $10,000 / 50 = $200 per defect.
17. Test Execution Time

Description: Measures the total time taken to execute test cases.
Derivation/Formula: Test Execution Time = Total Time Taken to Execute All Test Cases
Example: If it takes 30 hours to execute all test cases for a particular test cycle, the test execution time is 30 hours.
18. Automatable Test Cases

Description: Tracks the number of test cases that can be automated.
Derivation/Formula: Count of test cases identified as automatable.
Example: If 100 out of 200 test cases are identified as suitable for automation, there are 100 automatable test cases.
19. Automation Script Effectiveness

Description: Measures the effectiveness of automated test scripts in identifying defects.
Derivation/Formula: Automation Script Effectiveness (%) = (Number of Defects Detected by Automated Tests / Total Number of Defects Detected) * 100
Example: If 20 out of 40 defects are detected by automated tests, the automation script effectiveness is (20 / 40) * 100% = 50%.
20. Automation Pass Rate

Description: Measures the percentage of automated test scripts that pass without errors.
Derivation/Formula: Automation Pass Rate (%) = (Number of Passed Automated Tests / Total Number of Automated Tests Executed) * 100
Example: If 80 out of 100 automated tests pass, the automation pass rate is (80 / 100) * 100% = 80%.
21. Automation Execution Time

Description: Measures the total time taken to execute automated test scripts.
Derivation/Formula: Automation Execution Time = Total Time Taken to Execute Automated Test Scripts
Example: If it takes 10 hours to execute all automated test scripts for a particular test cycle, the automation execution time is 10 hours.
22. Automation Pyramid

Description: A conceptual framework for understanding the different levels of automated testing (unit tests, service tests, and UI tests) and their relative proportions.
Derivation/Formula: Visualization of test distribution across different levels.
Example: The pyramid illustrates that the base should be comprised of a large number of unit tests, followed by fewer service tests, and even fewer UI tests, ensuring a balanced and efficient test automation strategy.
