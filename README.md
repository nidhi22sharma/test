Example:
Unit Tests: If there are 200 unit tests out of a total of 400 tests, the percentage of unit tests is (200 / 400) * 100 = 50%.
Service Tests: If there are 120 service tests out of a total of 400 tests, the percentage of service tests is (120 / 400) * 100 = 30%.
UI Tests: If there are 80 UI tests out of a total of 400 tests, the percentage of UI tests is (80 / 400) * 100 = 20%.
Usage:

The Automation Pyramid helps QA teams visualize and balance the distribution of their automated tests to ensure optimal coverage and efficiency.
It supports the identification of areas that may require more or fewer tests, aiding in resource allocation and strategic planning.
This approach can be realigned to meet specific business needs, ensuring the test automation strategy remains flexible and effective.
